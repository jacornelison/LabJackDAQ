These are the things I had to install to get the code working on a fresh installation of ubuntu:

In personal experience, make sure to use sudo and not just su as that will change the usage permissions on the packages.

sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0

Download and extract labjack exodriver
cd labjack-exodriver-572cb7b/
sudo bash install.sh

Download and extract LabJackPython
cd LabJackPython-5-26-2015/
sudo python setup.py install

sudo apt-get install ipython # for testing

Download get-pip.py
sudo python get-pip.py

sudo apt-get install python-dev
sudo apt-get install python-tk

sudo pip install matplotlib
sudo pip install pyserial

sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0
